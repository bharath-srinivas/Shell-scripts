# Scripts

1. This repo contains the shell and python scripts written by me for performing some repetitive tasks.
2. I'll continue to add more scripts to this repo if I find some script written by me interesting or useful.
3. These scripts will automate the respective process for which a specific script is meant for, when used with cron.
4. In order to use these scripts, you just have to change the values for the path, file names, passwords etc, to your 
respective values and you're good to go.
